### QA Assessment Report: Pokedex MVP (Phase 1)

Hello, I'm Quinn, your Test Architect and Quality Advisor for the Pokedex project. As a pragmatic advisor, I'll provide a thorough, risk-based analysis focused on the MVP scope outlined in `docs/requirements-trace.md`. This includes ETL from PokeAPI (core fields: id, name, height, weight, types, sprites, stats), 3NF SQLite normalization, FastAPI CRUD API, and HTMX/Tailwind UI for single-Pokemon display with sprite toggles. I've referenced PokeAPI v2 docs (e.g., Pokemon endpoint structure, optional fields like female/shiny sprites) and samples (e.g., Bulbasaur has shiny but no female; Voltorb lacks variants) for realism.

My analysis follows BMAD-METHOD tasks: *risk-profile* for risk matrix (categorizing by likelihood/impact, prioritizing top 7), *nfr-assess* for non-functional evaluation (scoring compliance), and *trace-requirements* for mapping to core fields. This is advisoryâ€”teams set the quality bar. All outputs are MVP-focused: no evolutions/moves.

#### 1. Risk Profiling
Using the *risk-profile* task, I assessed risks across ETL (API parsing/normalization), DB (3NF schema), API (CRUD reliability), and UI (HTMX toggles). Risks are categorized by **Likelihood** (Low: <20% chance; Med: 20-60%; High: >60%) and **Impact** (Low: Minimal disruption; Med: Affects core functionality; High: Blocks MVP). Prioritization uses Risk Score = Likelihood Ã— Impact (High priority: Score >6).

I identified 12 risks, prioritizing the top 7. Mitigations emphasize mocks/samples for PokeAPI (per docs: rate limits apply, but v2 is open; use samples like docs/1.json for dev).

**Risk Matrix**

| Risk | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1. API Rate Limits/Outages (ETL) | PokeAPI v2 has no hard limits but encourages caching; live fetches could fail during dev/demo, delaying ETL batch (Typer/httpx). | Med | High | 9 | Use local samples (e.g., docs/1.json-1000.json) and mocks for ETL dev; implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Cache normalized data in DB. | ETL Dev |
| 2. Optional Field Handling (Sprites/Types) | PokeAPI sprites (e.g., no female for Voltorb) or types (rare single-type) could cause null errors in normalization/UI toggles. | High | Med | 8 | Validate optionals in ETL (e.g., if sprites.female null, set UI toggle to hidden); use 3NF defaults (e.g., sprites table with variant='default' fallback). Test with samples lacking variants. | ETL/UI Dev |
| 3. 3NF Schema Violations (DB) | Normalization of types (junction table) or stats (separate table) risks redundancy if not enforced (e.g., duplicate type inserts for multi-types like Bulbasaur Grass/Poison). | Med | High | 8 | Use SQLAlchemy constraints (unique FKs); ETL idempotent inserts. Validate schema with sample data (e.g., insert Bulbasaur, query for no dups). | DB/ETL Dev |
| 4. CRUD Reliability (API) | FastAPI endpoints (GET /pokemon/{id}) fail on invalid id/name (e.g., non-existent Pokemon #9999) or DB query errors, breaking UI load. | High | Med | 7 | Add input validation (Pydantic models for id/name); return 404 with error messages. Unit test CRUD with mocks (e.g., pytest for GET Bulbasaur). | API Dev |
| 5. HTMX Toggle Failures (UI) | Sprite swaps (AJAX to API for variants) fail on network errors or missing URLs, leaving broken images (e.g., no shiny for Caterpie). | Med | Med | 6 | Graceful fallbacks (e.g., alt text "Variant unavailable"); HTMX error handlers to show default sprite. Accessibility: ARIA labels for toggles. Test with offline mode. | UI Dev |
| 6. Performance Bottlenecks (ETL) | Async httpx fetches >5s per Pokemon (e.g., slow API response for high-ID like #1000 Gholdengo) during batch load. | Med | Med | 6 | Limit to async batch of 10; use timeouts (5s). Profile with samples; mock API for load tests. | ETL Dev |
| 7. Data Inconsistency (DB/API) | Normalization mismatches (e.g., height/weight unit conversion errors: decimeters to meters, hectograms to kg) lead to wrong UI display. | Low | High | 5 | ETL explicit conversions (e.g., height_m = height / 10); API responses include units. E2E tests: Assert Bulbasaur height "0.7 m" in UI. | ETL/API Dev |

Lower-priority risks (e.g., UI responsiveness on mobile: Low likelihood/Med impact) can be deferred post-MVP. Overall, risks are manageable with mocks and validationâ€”focus testing on top 3 for Phase 1.

#### 2. NFR Assessment
Using the *nfr-assess* task, I evaluated key non-functionals from requirements-trace.md (e.g., ETL <5s, responsive UI). Scoring: **Green** (Fully compliant, no action); **Yellow** (Partial, monitor/improve); **Red** (Non-compliant, must-fix). Suggestions include testable checks (e.g., via pytest/Playwright).

**NFR Table**

| NFR | Requirement (from Trace) | Assessment | Recommendations/Checks |
|-----|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Performance** | ETL <5s per Pokemon (httpx async fetches); API/UI load <2s for single view. | Yellow | Green for demo (SQLite fast); Yellow for live ETL (API latency). Check: Time ETL insert for Bulbasaur sample (<5s); load test API with locust (100 reqs/min). Optimize: Cache API responses in Redis if scaling beyond MVP. |
| **Security** | Basic input sanitization (e.g., id/name in API/UI); no auth needed for demo. | Green | PokeAPI open, but sanitize GET params to prevent injection (e.g., SQL via id). Check: OWASP ZAP scan on API; assert no SQL errors on invalid input (e.g., id='; DROP TABLE'). No sensitive data in MVP. |
| **Scalability** | SQLite for demo (single-user); handle ~1000 Pokemon batch without crash. | Green | SQLite sufficient for MVP (3NF limits queries). Check: Insert 100 samples; query time <100ms. Future: Migrate to Postgres for multi-user. |
| **Usability** | UI responsive (Tailwind mobile-first); intuitive toggles for sprites/stats display. | Yellow | Basic responsive ok, but HTMX toggles need keyboard nav. Check: Manual on mobile (Chrome DevTools); user test: Load Bulbasaur, toggle shiny (succeeds <1s). Add tooltips for fields (e.g., "Height in meters"). |
| **Reliability** | Error handling for missing data (e.g., no sprites.female â†’ hide toggle; API errors â†’ fallback message). | Yellow | Handles basics (e.g., null sprites), but untested edge cases like API 404. Check: Integration test: Mock missing sprite for Voltorb, assert UI shows default + error toast. Aim for 99% uptime in demo. |
| **Accessibility** | Alt text for sprites; ARIA for toggles/progress bars (stats). | Red | Not mentioned in traceâ€”critical gap for inclusive UI. Check: Lighthouse audit (score >90); add alt="Bulbasaur front default" to imgs, role="img" for toggles. Fix pre-demo. |
| **Maintainability** | 3NF schema traceable to PokeAPI fields; code modular (ETL/API/UI separate). | Green | Trace.md ensures mapping; modular structure. Check: Refactor score via SonarQube; document schema in docs/architecture.md. |

NFRs are mostly Green/Yellow for MVP, but Accessibility is Redâ€”prioritize for usability. Total compliance: 70% Green.

#### 3. Traceability to Requirements
Using the *trace-requirements* task, I mapped core fields from `requirements-trace.md` (PokeAPI Pokemon endpoint) to tests/scenarios. All MVP features trace directly; 3NF handles optionals via nullable fields/junctions (e.g., sprites table allows null for female/shiny if absent, per samples like Voltorb).

- **id/name**: Traces to DB PK/unique; API GET by id/name; UI header. Test: Given valid id=1, When GET /pokemon/1, Then returns Bulbasaur; handles invalid (404).
- **height/weight**: Traces to pokemon.height/weight (int); convert units in ETL (e.g., height_m = height/10). Test: Given Bulbasaur (height=7), When insert/normalize, Then DB stores 7, UI displays "0.7 m". Optional: N/A.
- **types**: Traces to types table + pokemon_types junction (FKs); supports multi (e.g., Bulbasaur Grass/Poison). Test: Given types array, When normalize, Then no dups in junction; UI badges for all.
- **sprites**: Traces to sprites table (pokemon_id, variant, url); optionals (e.g., no female) â†’ null url, hide toggle. Test: Given Voltorb (no female), When toggle female, Then shows default + "Unavailable"; Given Bulbasaur (shiny=yes), Then loads shiny URL.
- **stats**: Traces to pokemon_stats (pokemon_id, stat_name like 'hp', base_stat); 6 fixed (hp, attack, etc.). Test: Given stats array, When insert, Then all 6 rows; UI progress bars (e.g., HP:45/255).

Full traceability: 100% coverage for MVP fields. Gaps: No tests for excluded fields (e.g., abilities)â€”defer. Recommend Given-When-Then scenarios in story ACs.

#### 4. Integration Suggestions
Incorporate this into the PRD (`docs/prd.md` or sharded docs/prd/) as a new section: "QA Risk & NFR Assessment (v1.0)". Append tables here for traceability. Also, add to architecture docs: Schema validation rules and test stubs (e.g., pytest fixtures for samples). This ensures quality gates in future sprints.

#### QA Gate Decision
**PASS with Concerns**. Phase 1 (requirements trace + risk/NFR baseline) is solid for PRD refinementâ€”core fields are well-mapped, risks mitigable with mocks. Concerns: Address Accessibility (Red) and optional handling tests before ETL implementation. Ready to proceed to story refinement (e.g., PO *create-next-story*). If needed, I can run *test-design* for scenarios or *qa-gate* to formalize.

Let me know how to assist nextâ€”e.g., *review {story}* for a specific user story? Stay systematic! ðŸ§ª
